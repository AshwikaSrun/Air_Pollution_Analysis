# Air Pollution Analysis

This project analyzes air pollution data to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Gradient Boosting, CART, and KNN models. The focus is on preprocessing data, training models, and evaluating performance.

## Features
- Prediction of AQI using Gradient Boosting, CART, and KNN.
- Preprocessing of pollution and meteorological data.
- Visualization of results and model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Load the pollution dataset into `air_pollution_data.csv`.
2. Run `analysis.py` to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate predictions.
3. Visualize results using the included Matplotlib code.
